  1. Project Dependencies 
      * some packages are needed for the project's functionality to work 
      * will be part of prod build 

      npm i dropzone 
      npm i dropzone --save 
      npm i dropzone -S 

      will be tracked under in package.json file 

      "dependencies": {
        "dropzone": "6.0.0"
      }

  2. Development Dependencies
      * some packages are needed for the project to be developed 
      * needed during the time of development for better, smoother dev workflow
      * will never be part of prod build 

      npm i webpack --save-dev
      npm i webpack -D

      will be tracked under in package.json file 

      "devDependencies": {
        "webpack": "6.0.0"
      }
