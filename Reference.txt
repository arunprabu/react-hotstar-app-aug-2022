NodeJS Ecosystem

  1. Project Dependencies 
      * some packages are needed for the project's functionality to work 
      * will be part of prod build 

      npm i dropzone 
      npm i dropzone --save 
      npm i dropzone -S 

      will be tracked under in package.json file 

      "dependencies": {
        "dropzone": "6.0.0"
      }

  2. Development Dependencies
      * some packages are needed for the project to be developed 
      * needed during the time of development for better, smoother dev workflow
      * will never be part of prod build 

      npm i webpack --save-dev
      npm i webpack -D

      will be tracked under in package.json file 

      "devDependencies": {
        "webpack": "6.0.0"
      }




Webapps

  1. Server Side Rendering (SSR) Apps / Traditional Webapps 
      * pages will refresh

      Disadv

        1. one server has to do the heavy lifting 
        2. slower webapps 
        3. more bandwidth consumption
        4. more expensive
        5. chaotic codebase 


  2. Client Side Rendering (CSR) Apps  = SPA + REST API 
      * Pages will not refresh

          1 Server (Back End App + DB Queries)   - 8081

        5. Organized Codebase

  SPA Characteristics
  ---
    1. Page should not refresh [DONE]
    2. URL should change [DONE]
    3. History should be maintained w/o page refresh [DONE]
    4. Header and Footer should be intact. Should not be loaded again n again  [DONE]
    5. In between header and footer - page should be updated  [DONE]
    6. Active menu should be set [TODO]

ReactJS
=====
Components 
  1. Creating Component 
  2. Using Component 

  Types
  ---
    1. Functional Components [RECOMMENDED]
        * were called (before react v 16.8) as stateless components/ dumb components/presentational components 

        1.1 Functional Components with Named Functions 
        1.2 Functional Components with Anonymous Functions 
        1.3 Functional Components with Arrow Functions [RECOMMENDED]
        
    2. Class Components 
        * were called (before react v 16.8) as stateful components/ smart components/ containers 


JSX 
---
  * looks like HTML. but not HTML 
  * all elements should be either self-closed or separately closed
  * you can't have multiple children elements
  * html attribute class should become className


Cross Component Communication 
--
  1. Parent to Child Component Communication [DONE]
      Using Props 

  2. Child to Parent Component Communication [TODO]
      Using Props, States and also Events and callback (Render Props) 

  3. Any to Any Component Communication [LATER]
      Using Redux / Hooks (Context API)

  Routing in React using react-router-dom@6.2.1
--
   npm i react-router-dom@6.2.1


Step 1: identify URLS 
  Home  - localhost:3000/
  Concepts  - localhost:3000/concepts
  About  - localhost:3000/about

Step 2: 
---
  Identify the matching comp for the URL's 
    localhost:3000/   -- Home Comp
    localhost:3000/concepts   -- Concepts Comp
    localhost:3000/about   -- About Comp

Step 3: 
--
  Let's setup the href in Menu comp properly for each Menu
  
Step 4: 
--
  Config the URL's in App.js in between header and footer 

Step 5: 
--
  Check the app. Click the links. Comp's will be loaded in b/w header and footer.

  Let's stop the page refresh

  Replace <a href=''> with <NavLink to=''>
